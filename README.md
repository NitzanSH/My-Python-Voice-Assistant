#Welcome
#### This is my Python voice assistant
It's currently **WIP** as you can see and a **_name has to be found!_** (but that will come later on)
It will be built primarly with Python and I might use C# for desiging a nice GUI when I'll finish the pure coding.

##TO-DO List:
1. Most important, add a lot of commands :).
2. Improve the loading times a bit.
3. Adding some sweet ass GUI.
4. Improving the code (The shorter [and organized] the better).
5. Adding offline support (using sphinx).

## Needed modules:
1) speech_recognition.
2) webbrowser (not sure if its build in or not).
3) pyttsx.
4) win32api.
5) mtranslate.
