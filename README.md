#Welcome
#### This is my Python voice assistant
It's currently **WIP** as you can see and a **_name has to be found!_** (but that will come later on)
It will be built primarly with Python and I might use C# for desiging a nice GUI when I'll finish the pure coding.

##TO-DO List:
1. Most important, add a lot of commands :).
2. Improve the loading time a bit.
3. Adding some sweet ass GUI.
4. Improving the code (The shorter [and organized] the better).
5. Adding offline support (using sphinx).
